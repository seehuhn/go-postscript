## [v0.6.0] (2025-06-30)

### Added
- **25 new PostScript builtin operators** including mathematical functions (atan, cos, sin, sqrt, ln, log, exp, floor, ceiling, round, truncate, neg), arithmetic operators (div, idiv, mod), comparison operators (ge, gt, le, lt), bitwise operations (bitshift, xor), and type conversion functions (cvi, cvr)
- **IsBlank() method to Glyph type** in type1 package that returns true if the glyph has no drawing commands (LineTo or CurveTo operations)
- **New Outlines type** for separating outline data from Font struct, with methods for glyph bounding box calculations and blank glyph detection
- **Glyph name validation** with new IsValid() function in type1/names package
- **Dx() and Dy() methods** for funit.Rect16 type
- **SystemInfo type** in cid package with String() method for character collection identification

### Changed
- **Font struct refactored** to embed *Outlines instead of direct Glyphs, Private, and Encoding fields - methods NumGlyphs(), GlyphList(), and BuiltinEncoding() moved from Font to Outlines type
- **Glyph.BBox() method replaced** with Path() method that returns path.Path using updated geom/path package functionality
- **type1/names API updated** - ToUnicode and FromUnicode functions now use string values instead of runes
- **Updated dependency** seehuhn.de/go/geom to v0.6.0 with enhanced path functionality

### Fixed
- **Improved random key generation** in PostScript dictionary comparison function
- **Documentation typo** in CMap dictionary description

### Removed
- **Glyph.BBox() method** (replaced with Path() method for better integration with geom package)
